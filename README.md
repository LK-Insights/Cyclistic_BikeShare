## Hello Welcome to the Bike-Share Capstone Project!

### CYCLISTIC_BIKESHARE – GOOGLE DATA ANALYTIC PROFESSIONAL CAPSTONE <br>
This project explores a 12-month dataset of Cyclistic bike-share trips to better understand user behavior and inform marketing strategies. Using Excel, SQL, Tableau, and R, I performed data cleaning, transformation, analysis, and visualization. The analysis highlighted key differences in usage patterns between annual members and casual riders, leading to actionable, data-driven recommendations for targeted marketing campaigns.
