The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, my team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes diferently. From these insights, my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve my recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.\n\n## Business Task\n\nI was assigned to answer the following question: **How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?**\n\n## Datasets\n\nThe datasets can be found [here](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html). The original data is stored in CSV files, and each file has data of a specific month. This study uses data from June/2020 to May/2021, and a total of 12 CVS files are used.\n\nThis files contain observations about the rides:\n\n* identification code of the ride\n* type of rider (member or casual rider)\n* type of bike used\n* when the ride started (day and time)\n* when the ride ended (day and time)\n* where the ride started (station's information)\n* where the ride ended (station's information)\n\nThe available information allows me to compare number of rides and duration of the rides by members and casual riders. Doing this, it is possible to know how members and casual riders use bikes differently.\n\nThe data is\n\n* Reliable: The data source, Motivate International Inc, is reliable, and for the purpose of this educational study, the data is accurate, complete, and unbiased. However, it was collected during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n* Original: the data is validated with the original source, Motivate International Inc.\n\n* Comprehensive: the data contain all critical information needed to answer the question.\n\n* Current: so far, the lastest available data is from May/2021. \n\n* Cited: the data belongs to the City of Chicago’s Divvy bicycle sharing service and has been made available by Motivate International Inc.\n\nThe datasets protect the riders' information because there are no user ids that link rides and riders. It is impossible to know if two different rides were done by the same rider, how many rides one rider did, or how many different members and casual riders are represented.\n\n## Cleaning Data, Analysis, and Charts\n\nThe cleanning data process, the analysis, and the charts can be seen in the R Codification section below. Also, check the presentation slides for a summary of the results.\n\n## Presentation Slides\n\nHere are the presentation slides, incluing a summary of the analysis, charts, and recommendations. [Clique here to see them](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1e7SpP3EUKqcdFC46eNSjzfvQ7puF_pZz/view?usp=sharing).\n\nNote: In the slides, the charts were done using Tableau.\n\n## R Codification <a name=\"R-Codification\"></a> \n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#---------------------------------#\n# Installing and loading packages #\n#---------------------------------#\n\n# Instaling package tidyverse\n# install.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n\n# Loading libraries\nlibrary(tidyverse) \nlibrary(lubridate)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-27T17:06:49.196019Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-27T17:06:49.198337Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-27T17:06:50.571023Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#--------------------------------------------------------------#\n# Loading datasets and combining them into a single data frame #\n#--------------------------------------------------------------#\n\n# Loanding datasets (12 CSV files, one file per month, from June/2020 to May/2021)\njun_2020 <- read_csv(\"../input/bike-share/202006-divvy-tripdata.csv\")\njul_2020 <- read_csv(\"../input/bike-share/202007-divvy-tripdata.csv\")\naug_2020 <- read_csv(\"../input/bike-share/202008-divvy-tripdata.csv\")\nsep_2020 <- read_csv(\"../input/bike-share/202009-divvy-tripdata.csv\")\noct_2020 <- read_csv(\"../input/bike-share/202010-divvy-tripdata.csv\")\nnov_2020 <- read_csv(\"../input/bike-share/202011-divvy-tripdata.csv\")\ndec_2020 <- read_csv(\"../input/bike-share/202012-divvy-tripdata.csv\")\njan_2021 <- read_csv(\"../input/bike-share/202101-divvy-tripdata.csv\")\nfeb_2021 <- read_csv(\"../input/bike-share/202102-divvy-tripdata.csv\")\nmar_2021 <- read_csv(\"../input/bike-share/202103-divvy-tripdata.csv\")\napr_2021 <- read_csv(\"../input/bike-share/202104-divvy-tripdata.csv\")\nmay_2021 <- read_csv(\"../input/bike-share/202105-divvy-tripdata.csv\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-27T17:06:58.296039Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-27T17:06:58.327367Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-27T17:07:37.528961Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Some investigations and adjustments are needed in order to combine the files.\n\n# Comparing column names\nif (colnames(jun_2020)==colnames(jul_2020)\n && colnames(jul_2020)==colnames(aug_2020)\n && colnames(aug_2020)==colnames(sep_2020)\n && colnames(sep_2020)==colnames(oct_2020)\n && colnames(oct_2020)==colnames(nov_2020)\n && colnames(nov_2020)==colnames(dec_2020)\n && colnames(dec_2020)==colnames(jan_2021)\n && colnames(jan_2021)==colnames(feb_2021)\n && colnames(feb_2021)==colnames(mar_2021)\n && colnames(mar_2021)==colnames(apr_2021)\n && colnames(apr_2021)==colnames(may_2021)) {\nprint(\"Column names are consistent, and there is no need to rename them.\")\n} else {\nprint(\"Column names are not consistent.
